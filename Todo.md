## Task
Depricate AD Group Functionality

USC are moving away from AD Group targeting in USC.

### Milestones

* Remove Creation of AD Groups
* All deployments should be created to 2 targets. A Pilot and a Production.
* If a deployment is restricted it should go to All USC Staff and Students with 'Requires Administrative approval'
* Otherwise a deployment should be deployed to machine collection.

_Notes_ 
Deployments should be targetted to Pilot for 1-2 weeks prior to becoming available to production deployment.
Production deployments should become available for 1-2 weeks prior to deadlining. This will allow seekers to get the latest updates asap.


## Progress

* ~Remove Creation of AD Group~
* Add creation of pilot collections (per app?)
* Setup specific deployments for pilot and prod
